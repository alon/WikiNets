Sample Visualization of Related Concepts
===

Modify and run `python create_sample_data.py` to create javascript files which are referenced by `sample_page.html`.

Then open `sample_page.html` and it should render a graph which clusters related concepts.

There is no logic normalizing the spacing of the resulting graph so it will typically have to be manually adjusted a bit.
